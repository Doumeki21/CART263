# Project 1: A Night at the Movies - Rejection

**Olenka Yuen**

This project is inspired by DUSTCELL'S music video called Mad Hatter. A reason why I chose a music video over a movie is because, it is usually open to a lot of interpretation, which allows me to explore different paths (in terms of concept and mechanics).

My personal interpretation of the song is that the protagonist is dealing with sibling rivalry. There were multiple instances in the music video where the girl would look at her elder sister in a hostile manner and moments of her not being acknowledged by her parents, leading to lots of stress, rejection, and chaos in the end.

To start off, my choice of colours, fonts, and other visuals are based on the narration of the music video. For example, the idea of the elder sister taking up the protagonist's whole identity can be represented by the boss' health bar (which is the same length as the user's screen) and the larger letter A compared to the F. The idea of the A+ as the player's target is similar to the protagonist's goal of competing with a her sister, someone with a good reputation. While the play on the F's shape presents the main character's failure to be acknowledged, leading to the manipulation of a pistol gun (a symbol of violence and control). In addition, the use of red colours symbolizes the protagonist's rage as well as the moment she gave in to the Mad Hatter within her. Despite the colourful chaos of shapes, the environment's overall lack of colour shows the girl's dying emotions (loss of empathy).

The goal of the game is to defeat the “A+” by shooting bullets at it. Once the protagonist has defeated her source of stress, then she will be free.

# How to Play
- Strike the boss (A+) by pressing the UP ARROW key.
- Move the player (F) using WASD.
- Rotate the player and aim using the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys.
- If the player's health falls short, speak "I need to heal" into the computer mic.

# Improvements to Make (Prevented from deadline)
- I enjoyed manipulating with text. If I had more time, I would have loved to explore more into the game's UI and other design elements.
- I could have added dialogue using JSON data to make it more story driven.
