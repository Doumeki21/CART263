# Project 1: A Night at the Movies - Rejection

**Olenka Yuen**

This project is inspired by DUSTCELL'S music video called Mad Hatter. A reason why I chose a music video over a movie is because I feel like it is open to a lot of interpretation, which allows me to explore different directions (in terms of concept and mechanics).

My personal interpretation of the song is that the protagonist is dealing with sibling rivalry, leading to a lot of stress, rejection, and chaos in the end. To start off, my choice of colors, fonts, and other visuals are based on the "narration" of the music video. For example, the idea of the elder sister taking up the protagonist's whole identity can be represented by the boss' health bar (which is the same length as the user's screen) and the larger letter A compared to the F. While the play on the F's shape can be interacted as a pistol gun. In addition, the use of red colors symbolizes the protagonist's rage as well as the moment she gave in to the Mad Hatter within her. Despite the colorful chaos, the environment's overall lack of color shows the girl's dying emotions (empathy).

The goal of the game is to defeat the A+ by shooting bullets at it. Once the protagonist has defeated her source of stress, then she will be free.



**Improvements to make**
- I enjoyed manipulating with text. If I had more time, I would have loved to explore more into the game's UI and other design elements.
- I could have added dialogue using JSON data to make it more story driven.
