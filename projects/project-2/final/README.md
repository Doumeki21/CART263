# Final Project

**Olenka Yuen**

*"Are you ready?"*
*"No..."*
*"It's ok, just jump your best and God will pave your way."*

My vision for this project is reflecting the experience of learning in school and the fear of entering society. (However, the game is open to interpretation).

This project began as an inspiration of the online game, Helix Jump. I took its simple idea of getting the ball to reach the end of the puzzle, while also including a different and/ or new element every time you pass a level. Every level is like a grade, once you pass a grade, the next one will introduce a new topic for you to learn. These levels are steady to have you get accustomed to the rules, similar to the school environment. Once you pass the fourth level, you "graduate" and enter society. This is implied when the music changes to a more intense rhythm and the appearance of new obstacles to dodge. But of course, where there’s the bad, comes the good. In exchange for all the negative events, you can also heal yourself by voice command. However, you mustn’t spend too much time healing because there’s a time limit!

(how you believe you accomplished this both technically and artistically)

(accomplishments)

A lot of the rules and instructions aren’t directly mentioned in the game and you have to figure it out by trial and error  (Although some hints are already noted here in the README file, The alert for the mic if you’re using the Firefox browser, or visually hinted in the game like the changing colours of the ball’s outline, etc)


The goal for each level is simple: get the ball to reach at the bottom of the screen!

# How to Play
