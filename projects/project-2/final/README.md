# Artistic Goals

My vision for this project is reflecting the experience of learning in school and the fear of entering society. Even if the goal is simple, the journey may not be so and requires one to encounter lots of obstacles.

This project began as an inspiration of the online game, Helix Jump. I took its simple idea of getting the ball to reach the end of the puzzle, while also including a different and/ or new element every time you pass a level. Every level is like a grade, once you pass a grade, the next one will introduce a new topic for you to learn. These levels are steady to have you get accustomed to the rules, similar to the school environment. Once you pass the fourth level, you "graduate" and enter society. This is implied when the music changes to a more intense rhythm and the appearance of new obstacles to dodge. But of course, every cloud has a silver lining. In exchange for all the negative events, you can also heal yourself by voice command. However, you must not spend too much time healing because there is a time limit!

The overall lack of colors give a sense of a bleak life, while the opposite hold true to the obstacles. After all, it's the act of overcoming obstacles and achieving accomplishments that make life more meaningful.

# Accomplishments

Because every level introduces a new element, I could not use the inheritance method from the parent class, so I connected each level to its previous class, while also carrying the lives over to keep track of it throughout the game. Due to all the interconnected variables and objects, I have learned to think more critically as to what should fall into its own class, what is not necessary to, and what is better to be a universal variable. Exploring other ways of connecting objects to different classes, as well as connecting library functions across classes, allowed me to grasp a much better understanding and more advanced p5.js coding compared to my other works.

Reflecting back to last project, I took the chance to balance the difficulty of the game by adding and changing the mechanics in each level (especially cranking up the difficulty of the last level by overlapping more objects and different mechanics for the player to get used to in a shorter amount of time. - which also falls into the theme of this work).

# How to Play

A lot of the rules and instructions aren’t directly mentioned in the game and you have to figure it out by trial and error (although some hints are already noted here in the README file, The alert for the mic if you’re using the Firefox browser, or visually hinted in the game like the changing colours of the ball’s outline, etc.). Here are some basic instructions:

- Use the Google Chrome browser to access the annyang! library.
- Use the right and left arrow keys to control the environment.
- Recite "recover now" to heal 1 life (accessible in level 5).
