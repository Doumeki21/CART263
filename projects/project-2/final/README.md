# Final Project

**Olenka Yuen**

This project is inspired by the online game, Helix Jump. I took the simple idea of getting the ball to reach the end of the puzzle, but also introducing a different or new element every time you pass a level. My approach to it is my experience of learning in school (however, the game may be open to interpretation). Every level is like a grade, once you pass a grade, the next one will introduce a new topic for you to learn. Once you pass the fourth level, you graduate and enter society.


The goal for each level is simple: get the ball to reach at the bottom of the screen!

Thanks for Sharon and Pippin's help!
