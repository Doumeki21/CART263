# Exercise 01: Whereâ€™s Sausage Dog? New Game+

GOAL: find the sausage dog within 10 seconds!

NOTE:
- There is a timer on the top left corner that counts down from 10 (seconds). If the timer reaches 0 before you find the sausage dog, you lose.

- If you click anywhere besides the sausage dog during the game, the screen dims and shakes.

- The "PN" in the comments just means personal notes.
